### Steps to run

+ While running in our local systems we hosted the dataset on a shared google drive which might not be accessible to someone else who might clone this project, so appropriately you need to change the path in the beginning cells of the notebook
+ The notebook can be opened in Google colab.
+ If you're using the datasets from the github repo, make sure they are also uploaded to some place which is accessible from your colab notebook, for example, we had a shared drive as a team to work on the notebook. You can upload the dataset on your own drive and then use it, since the required code for reading and accessing google drive is already present in the notebook.
